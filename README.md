# AI-Fundamentals
This collection was built as programming assignments for an AI-fall 2024 course at IASBS. It serves as both a learning tool and a reference for exploring different search and optimization strategies.

## Included Algorithms

### Uninformed Search
- A* (A-star)
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- DLS (Depth-Limited Search)
- IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)
- UCS (Uniform-Cost Search)

### Informed & Local Search
- Hill Climbing

### Metaheuristics
- PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)
- SA (Simulated Annealing)

## Visual Example

The Simulated Annealing implementation includes a demo using the Ackley function to show how the algorithm explores and optimizes over time

## File Overview

- `main.py` â€“ Entry point to run or test algorithms  
- Search algorithms: `BFS.py`, `DFS.py`, `DLS.py`, `IDS.py`, `UCS.py`, `AS.py`  
- Local/metaheuristic algorithms: `HC.py`, `PSO.py`, `SA.py`  
- Helpers: `Function_Generator.py`  
- Visualization: `Informed_Vis.py`, `Uninformed_Vis.py`  


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. (Optional) Inspect or tweak algorithm parameters.
